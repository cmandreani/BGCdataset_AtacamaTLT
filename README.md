# BGC dataset - Atacama (TLT)

Repository of specialized meabolite-encoding genomic regions of 5,000 bp or longer predicted in 42 soil bacterial MAGs from the Atacama Desert (Talabre-Lej√≠a transect).  

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10680981 

## Data Availability

Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are available in fasta and genbank formats:
- [download sequences of BGCs (.fa)](https://github.com/cmandreani/BGCdataset_AtacamaTLT/blob/main/BGCs_seqs_fastas.zip?raw=true)
- [download annotations of BGCs (.gbk)](https://github.com/cmandreani/BGCdataset_AtacamaTLT/blob/main/BGCs_annots_gbks.zip?raw=true)

Genome sequences of assembled MAGs are deposited at the NCBI database under the BioProject accession PRJNA291433.
