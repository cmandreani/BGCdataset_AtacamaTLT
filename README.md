### BGC dataset - Atacama (TLT)

Repository of specialized meabolite-encoding genomic regions of 5,000 bp or longer predicted in 42 soil bacterial MAGs of the Atacama Desert (Talabre-Lej√≠a transect).
DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10680981 

## Data Availability

Sequences and annotations of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are available for download in fasta and genbank formats.
