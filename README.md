# BGC dataset - Atacama Desert (TLT)

Repository of specialized meabolite-encoding genomic regions of 5,000 bp or longer predicted in 42 soil bacterial MAGs from Atacama's Talabre-Lej√≠a transect.  

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10680981 

## Data Availability

Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are available in fasta and genbank formats:
