# BGC dataset - Atacama Desert (TLT)

Repository of specialized metabolite-encoding genomic regions of 5,000 bp or longer.
Predicted in 38 soil bacterial MAGs from Atacama's Talabre-Lej√≠a transect, Antofagasta, Chile.  

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10680981 

## Data Availability

Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are available in fasta and genbank formats:
- [download sequences of BGCs (.fa)](https://github.com/cmandreani/BGCdataset_AtacamaTLT/raw/main/BGCs_seqs_fastas.zip)
- [download annotations of BGCs (.gbk)](https://github.com/cmandreani/BGCdataset_AtacamaTLT/raw/main/BGCs_annots_gbks.zip)

Genome sequences of assembled MAGs are deposited at the NCBI database under the BioProject accession PRJNA291433.
